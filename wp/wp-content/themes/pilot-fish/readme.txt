== FAQ ==
1. To display the Project Archive page, please create a new page, and set the page template to "Project Archive", then change the slug to "project". Or add the custom link "http://yoursitename.com/project/" to your menu. You may need to update your "Permalinks" in "Settings" for the page to work.
